# My Projects
## Predictive Modeling of car's fuel economy
- ### Overview: Developed a statistically significant regression model that predicts a car's fuel economy (in mpg) given a car's weight, with a MAE of 3.3 miles per gallon.

## Simulation of a Queuing system using Python
- ### Overview :  Developed a simulation model that allows the optimization of a given queuing system (i.e, a car wash line, a fuel station, parking lot, etc). Providing decision support about scheduling staffing and queue system design given certain demand and service rate.

## Predicting medical appointments no-show
- ### Overview: Created a tool that estimates whether a patient will show or not at a scheduled medical appointment (Accuracy=0.75%) to give a better understanding of why the patients would miss an appointment and provide information to clinical facilities for improving efficiency and productivity.
